# Artificial light at night (ALAN) decreases plant diversity and performance in experimental grassland communities – Data on species biomass and traits

[https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.hhmgqnknt](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.hhmgqnknt)

In ALAN\_specis\_biomass.csv, Biomass per species in the proportion sorted is given. In ALAN\_biomass.csv, the biomass of the entire Ecotron is given. In ALAN\_traits.csv, traits of the species are given.

## Description of the data and file structure

ALAN\_specis\_biomass.csv:
The species are abbreviated by 3 letters genus and species. unit describes the name of the EcoUnit (numbered consecutively), light refers to the light regime (given in lux), mass indicates the biomass (in g dry matter) and harvest denotes whether it was the first or 2nd harvest studied (categorical information).

ALAN\_biomass.csv:
biomass refers to biomass (g dry matter), unit describes the name of the EcoUnit (numbered consecutively), and harvest denotes whether it was the first or 2nd harvest studied. Treatment refers to the light regime (in lux).

ALAN\_traits.csv:
Species and EcoUnit are given as above. Treatment refers to the light regime (in lux).. Hair density is hairiness (hairs mm-2), besides that toughness (N mm<sup>-1</sup>), contact angle (CA\_Mean, °), fresh weight (g), dry weight (g), leaf area (cm<sup>2</sup>), specific leaf area (SLA; cm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>), leaf dry matter content (mg g<sup>-1</sup>), SPAD, plant height (cm) and the chlorophyll parameters FvFm and PIabs are given as described in Methods.
